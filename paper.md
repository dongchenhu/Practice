# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP 

Jones et al (1998) conducted serval studies in this region,
but continental- scale measurements have not previously been made

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which 
measurements in th literature can be applied at regional scale.

# Simulations 
We simulation the evolution of particle sizes as the are transported 
away from the source region

# Methodology 
We compared our measurements of particle aging with a model simulation.
The model is detailed in Smith etal 2002.

# Results
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth
mechanism for the baba

# Figures
Figures go in their own sections in a draft paper.
