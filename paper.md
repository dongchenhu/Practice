#Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP 

Jones et al (1998) conducted serval studies in this region,
but continental- scale measurements have not previously been made

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which 
measurements in th literature can be applied at regional scale.
